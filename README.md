# playlist

This is a music play list. The goal is to practice object oriented javascript.

First commit:
So far, I created a song class and a playlist object, there are 3 objects in the song class. and there are 3 buttom that control which song to "play". The 3 exiting objects can be displayed. The problem is however, I want to be able to create new song object from the interface.
This has not been working, right now I am trying to just add one song, however, the song class properties does not seem to accept value from the input, ever time I try the properties come back as empty strings.
